    <h4 class="question">
      Will this help me build my credit?
    </h4>
    <p class="answer">
        Typically upon purchase of a vehicle, the credit bureau receives a report of your payments. Through prompt payments, a vehicle purchase can be a potential factor in credit repair.
    </p>
    <h4 class="question">
      How will I know the amount I've been approved for?
    </h4>
    <p class="answer">
        There are particular aspects to be considered in computing the pre-approval amount. Once the financial expert handling your account tied you up with the suited vehicle within your monthly budget, you will then be informed.
    </p>
    <h4 class="question">
      Where can I find your office?

    </h4>

    <!-- Questions -->
    <h4 class="question">
      What are your minimum requirements?
    </h4>
    <p class="answer">
        1. At least 18 years of age<br />
        2. With a valid driver’s license<br />
        3. Can acquire an insurance
    </p>
    <h4 class="question">
      Do I have to make a down payment?
    </h4>
    <p class="answer">
        Although this is not a requirement, it usually helps in coming up with a low monthly payment which eventually allows you to pay off your vehicle quickly.
    </p>
    <h4 class="question">
      Do I need a credit check?
    </h4>
    <p class="answer">
        A credit check is needed to process your approval.
    </p>
    <h4 class="question">
      Am I required to have a co-signer?
    </h4>
    <p class="answer">
        Usually, this is not a requirement, but the necessity of a cosigner will be based on the information of the whole duration of the application process. Our application process is free and requires no obligation to make a purchase, so you are open to looking for your possible choices.
    </p>
    <h4 class="question">
      Am I obligated to buy a car once I apply?
    </h4>
    <p class="answer">
        No. Our dealership contacts you initially to inform you of your options. This phase helps you come up with a sound decision on whether you like to purchase a vehicle.
    </p>
    <h4 class="question">
      I have declared backruptcy before. Can you still help me?
    </h4>
    <p class="answer">
        Definitely yes. Over the years, we have mastered helping people in all sorts of situations get specific financing plans, even for those who are bankrupt. Your case might take a little bit longer because we have to solicit information from your trustee, but most of the time we can lay out great options for our customers.
    </p>
    <h4 class="question">
      Do you accomodate those who receive income assistance?
    </h4>
    <p class="answer">

    <h4 class="question">
      Am I required to have a co-signer?
    </h4>
    <p class="answer">
        Interest rates vary from one customer to another. Several factors are considered such as the amount financed, the term and exact approval that each customer is qualified. You can decide your length of payment term considering you would want to pay for a longer period or you want to pay off your loan sooner.
